# MicrosoftSearch

This repository is intended to support working with Microsoft Search and custom connectors. It contains helpful links to other resources, PowerShell samples, and presentations from events on the topic.

## PowerShell

This directory demonstrates how you can create a new Graph Connector for Microsoft Search with some simple scripts. The * *.ps1* scripts are numbered in sequence. You need to create a new app in your Azure AD as described at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-service.

The *event-demo.csv* file contains two lines with sample data to import. It corresponds to the defined scheme.  
The *result-type*.json* files are Adaptive Cards for visualizing the search results for the custom data.
